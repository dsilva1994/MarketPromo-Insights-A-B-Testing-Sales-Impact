# MarketPromo-Insights-A-B-Testing-Sales-Impact

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the results of a marketing experiment conducted by a fast-food company to evaluate three different promotional campaigns. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of these campaigns by analyzing sales revenue data across multiple locations over four weeks.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to:

- Compare the effectiveness of three different promotions using A/B testing.
- Determine which promotion generates the highest sales revenue.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to the marketing team on the best-performing promotion.
- Evaluate whether the observed differences in sales revenue are statistically significant.

Data
- The dataset consists of sales revenue data collected from multiple locations over four weeks. It includes the following columns:

- Promotion: The type of promotional campaign (1, 2, or 3).
- LocationID_sales_count: The number of locations participating in the campaign.
- Average_sales: The average sales revenue for each promotion across locations.
- Standard_deviation: The standard deviation of sales revenue for each promotion.
- Total_sales: The total sales revenue for each promotion across all locations.

# Methodology
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- The data was first examined to understand the distribution of sales across the three promotions and the variability between them.
- We visualized the sales distribution, market sizes, and promotion performance.
- Additional statistical checks were performed to check for potential confounding variables, such as market size and store age.


## 2. Statistical Testing
Three two-sample T-tests were performed to compare each pair of promotions:
- Promotion 1 vs. Promotion 2
- Promotion 1 vs. Promotion 3
- Promotion 2 vs. Promotion 3
A 99% confidence level was used, meaning an alpha level of 0.01 to reduce the risk of Type I errors.


## 3. Recommendations and Next Steps

- Based on the statistical analysis, Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 are the most effective campaigns.
- Promotion 2 should be discontinued.
- A follow-up experiment comparing Promotions 1 and 3 should be conducted to select the best-performing campaign in the long term.
- The experiment could be extended beyond four weeks to capture long-term effects and account for additional variability.

## 4. Limitations
- The experiment ran for only 4 weeks, which may not fully capture long-term trends.
- Confounding variables such as store age and market size may influence the results.
